  * Enable nowrap in the default configuration. Although we use the
    --disable-wrapping-as-root compile option, it isn't enough for many
    reasons, as described by Anders Kaseorg in #513443. Users wishing to
    revert this can edit the global config, or use "unset nowrap" in
    their personal nanorc. Closes: #253298, #513443, and Ubuntu bugs

nano (1.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Good bye, Pico" release.
  * It has been decided (Bug#202636) that Pico is now an "unsupported"
    package and nano is going to replace it. Except for the Pine-specific
    features, nano does everything Pico does, and more. So, lets whack
    the pico package a bit from now on (closes: #142943).
  * debian/control:
    + add Conflicts:,Replaces: pico to nano.
    + remove unproven claim from description.
    + build-depend on gettext.
    + Standards-Version: 3.6.0.0.
  * debian/changelog: recoded as UTF-8.
  * debian/links: add /usr/bin/pico -> nano symlink, likewise for manpage.

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Feb 2003 17:21:02 +0100

nano (1.1.99pre2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    + Build-Depend on slang1-utf8-dev, so nano-udeb works in debian-installer
      as it should. This means that nano-tiny also needs to be compiled with
      slang-utf8, as slang1-dev and slang1-utf8-dev conflict.
    + This also means that nano-tiny now Conflicts:, Provides: and Replaces:
      nano-tiny-utf8, and obsoletes the nano-bf source package.
    + drop autoconf, automake from Build-Depends, again, and tighten debhelper
      to >= 4.0.0.
    + Standards-Version: 3.5.8.0 (no changes).
  * debian/compat: use DH_COMPAT=4.
  * nano.c: move setlocale() call out of the ENABLE_NLS ifdef, so 8bit chars
    work in nano-tiny with slang-utf8. Thanks to Junichi Uekawa for the
    solution (closes: #152238, from nano-tiny-utf8).

    + should not segfault on wraps of indented lines (closes: #178863).
    + should not segfault when trying to edit a directory (closes: #177408).
    + in short... it should not segfault :)
  * debian/nanorc: updated, enable search history by default.

nano (1.1.99pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream prerelease. We're getting there!
    + this version won't open empty buffers named after directories when
      trying to open them (closes: #175021).
  * As I haven't mucked with configure.ac, there shouldn't be problems
    with m68k now (closes: #175397).
  * Home and End appear to work ok with the latest gnome-terminal in unstable
    (closes: #159214).
  * debian/rules:
    + fix rule dependencies (closes: #176764).
    + add support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt, drop debug.
    + minor cleanups...
    + ... but expect a rewrite of this mess very soon.

nano (1.1.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream development release.
    + po files are correct, translations of yes/no should work in all
    languages (closes: #165632).
  * Apply --disable-wrapping-as-root forward port by David Lawrence Ramsey,
    which accidentally didn't go in this release and which we need for the
    installation (closes: #135978 + 5 more). To do wrapping as root, you need
    to override this with a /root/.nanorc. A global "unset nowrap" will be
    ignored for the superuser.
  * Ran autoconf && autoheader on the source package to not need to build dep
    on the thing.

    other reports of nano-tiny segfaults from other testers. Sean, if

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Jul 2001 13:22:25 +0200

nano (1.0.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

    (closes: #103836).

nano (1.0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * This release fixes the suspend bug (closes: #100928).

    policy. Thanks for the notice, xtifr (closes: #97061).

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Sun, 13 May 2001 11:49:59 +0200

nano (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control: remove Conflicts and Replaces between nano and
    nano-tiny, but nano still conflicts with older nano-tiny's.
    Both packages can coexist now.
  * debian/rules:
    + binary for nano-tiny is renamed from 'nano' to 'nano-tiny' and
      moved to /bin.
    + both nano-tiny and nano-udeb configure with --disable-wrapping,
      which closes: #92003, and saves about 2.5kb in the binary.
  * debian/nano-tiny.{dirs,postinst,prerm}: update to new binary location.
  * debian/nano-tiny.postinst: downgrade nano-tiny's editor alternative
    priority to "0" (closes: #87128).

    + Ok, "Standard" != "standard"...

nano (0.9.99pre3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control:
    + removed silly sentence from nano-udeb's description.
    + changed -udeb's priority to Standard.
    + s/nano/GNU nano/ in the description, as Nano is official GNU software
      now.
  * debian/rules: remove the new info pages from -tiny.

nano (0.9.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Many, many changes have taken place in the nano development since
    Potato's 0.8.6, and many improvements have been added:
    + Internationalization support, with es, de, fr and it translations
    + New Slang support, along with other optimizations, making nano
      smaller (using --enable-tiny at compile time). It is possible that a
      new nano-tiny package will be added to the distribution soon.
    + Speed improvements due to code cleanups.
    + Last but not least, it ships with less segfaults now :)
  * debian/rules: manual install of nano.xpm, a small logo for the GNOME
    panel and other menu methods.
  * debian/nano.xpm: small and simple logo for nano made by me.

nano (0.8.6-3) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Richard: Frozen target because it fixes a nasty bug on symlink handling.
    I guess that applies to "destruction of data" severity... read below.
  * Backported some bugfixes from new upstream versions to fix various
    bugs:
    + segfaults related to update_line().
    + handling of control characters (closes: #60883).
    + strange cursor behaviour in certain column values (partially fixes
      #60885).
    + removal of the extra "newline" at the end of files. This also fixes
      some segfaults (closes: #62440).
    + fixed the handling of symlinks. Nano replaced links by the original
      files before. This was not reported, but I think it's a RC bug.
    + Correct handling of 8bit characters.
    Thank you Chris!
  * Added a new patch from Chris which fixes the long lines behaviour
    completely (closes: #60885).
  * Fixed PageUp & Down cursor placement.

    weird bugs which are fixed in 0.8.6. (Closes: #58891, release-critical
