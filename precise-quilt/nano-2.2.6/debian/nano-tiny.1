.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invoke bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBnano\fP is a small, free and friendly editor which aims to replace
Pico, the default editor included in the non-free Pine package. Rather
than just copying Pico's look and feel,
.B nano
also implements some missing (or disabled by default) features in Pico,
such as "search and replace" and "goto line number".
.br
.B nano-tiny
is a special, minimal build of the program, aimed for Debian's boot-floppies
or emergency disks.
